# solved_problems

So we made promise to solve at least 1 problem everyday. This repository is for that purpose. 

Problems are taken from:
1. leetcode.com
2. codeforces
3. SPOJ
4. codechef.com
5. codesignal.com

Here are the [link to algorithms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U_d78V0lFzlG5tCKOMC-iA9ywdNim3XkLpnzJDC_qx4/edit?usp=sharing) pseudocodes that we learned throughout problem solving. Enjoy!
